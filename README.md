Design of Experiments (DOE) Tool
The Design of Experiments (DOE) Tool is a web-based application designed to facilitate the creation and analysis of experimental designs. It allows users to input factors and their levels, generate a design matrix, and input measurements for analysis.

Features
Dynamic Factor Input: Add any number of factors and specify their levels. Name each factor for clarity.

Design Matrix Generation: Automatically generate a design matrix based on the input factors, levels, and a specified reduction factor.

Measurement Input: Dynamically add columns to input measurements for each experiment in the design matrix.

Python Backend: Utilizes the power of Python libraries in the browser using Pyodide.

Usage
Input Factors and Levels:
Click on the "Add Factor" button to add a new factor.
For each factor, provide a name and specify its levels.
Generate Design Matrix:
After adding all the desired factors, adjust the reduction factor and click on the "Generate Array" button.
The tool will display a design matrix where you can input the measurements for each experiment.
Input Measurements:
After generating the design matrix, you can dynamically add columns to input measurements for each experiment.
Future Enhancements
Implement advanced statistical analyses for the designs.

Add functionality to save, export, and import designs and measurements.

Improve mobile responsiveness for better accessibility on various devices.
