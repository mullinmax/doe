# Taguchi Method Tool

The Taguchi Method Tool is a web-based application designed to facilitate the application of the Taguchi method for optimizing product and process parameters. The tool allows users to input factors and levels, generate an orthogonal array, and analyze the results.

## Features

- **Dynamic Factor Input**: Add any number of factors and specify their levels.
- **Orthogonal Array Generation**: Automatically generate an orthogonal array based on the input factors and levels.
- **Results Analysis**: Input results for each experiment and get a basic analysis of the average results for each level of each factor.

## Usage

1. **Input Factors and Levels**:
   - Click on the "Add Factor" button to add a new factor.
   - For each factor, provide a name and specify the number of levels.

2. **Generate Orthogonal Array**:
   - After adding all the desired factors, click on the "Generate Orthogonal Array" button.
   - The tool will display an orthogonal array where you can input the results for each experiment.

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - After inputting all the results, click on the "Analyze Results" button.
   - The tool will display the average result for each level of each factor.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement advanced statistical analyses for the Taguchi method.
- Add functionality to save and export results.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for better accessibility on various devices.
